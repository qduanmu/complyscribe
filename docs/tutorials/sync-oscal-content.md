# The trestlebot command line sync-oscal-content Tutorial

This tutorial provides how to use `trestlebot sync-oscal-content` sync OSCAL models to [CaC content](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content).

Currently, this command has one sub-command: `cac-control`

## cac-control

This command is to sync OSCAL Component Definition files to CaC content profile file and control files.

The CLI performs the following sync:

- Sync OSCAL component definition parameters/rules changes to CaC content profile file
- Sync OSCAL component definition parameters/rules changes to CaC content control file
- Add a hint comment to the control file when a missing rule is found in the CaC content repo.
- Sync OSCAL component definition control status changes to CaC content control file. Since status mapping between
cac and OSCAL is many-to-many relationship, if status can not be determined when sync, then add a comment to let user
decide. Discussion detail in [doc](https://github.com/complytime/trestle-bot/discussions/511)
- Add new option to cac var file when found variable exists but missing the option we sync.

### 1. Prerequisites

- Pull the [CaC Content repository](https://github.com/ComplianceAsCode/content).
